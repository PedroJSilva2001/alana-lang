# Chapter 3. Lexical Structure
This chapter specifies the lexical structure of the Alana programming language.

Programs are written using Unicode characters. However, lexical translations are provided so that Unicode escapes can be used to include any Unicode character using only ASCII characters. Line terminators are defined in to support the different system conventions.

The Unicode characters resulting from the lexical translations are reduced to an input sequence composed of white space, comments and tokens. The tokens are the identifiers, keywords, literals, separators, and operators of the Alana programming language.
