# Alana: A precious and exalted programming language ðŸ˜ŠðŸ˜Š

Alana is a toy programming language I'm developing to learn important language design concepts and their challenges.

## Language Classification
The language intends to follow an imperative paradigm with some functional patterns.

It is a general purpose, but you can use it for any task. With its strong + static type system and pointer accesses (with added pointer safety), Alana is a modern language ideal for systems design.

## Docs structure
The folder [spec](./spec/) contains both the [language specification](./spec/lang/) and its [standard lib specification](./spec/lib/).

In [guides](./guides/), you can find code examples with explanations on how to use Alana in practice.
